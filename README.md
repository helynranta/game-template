# 👨🏼‍💻 GAME TEMPLATE
This is my game template repository. I use it to create a new game project fast.

## How can I use it?
For now my engine repo is private, so there is nothing you can do with this. 
However if you are looking into how to create great c++ cross repo projects this might be of some use.
